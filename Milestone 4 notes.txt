m4 notes:

TCPServer.cs, line 294 (for(int i = 0; i < numberPlayers; i++))
It's going by numberPlayers, which is the TOTAL player slots. 
So when there's only one client connected, and there are more who haven't, 
they'll always throw a null object exception because it's looping through it.

Client.cs, line 213 (stream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);)
Threw a null reference exception
It was after connecting the debug client as the second player.
(In "this" in the locals window, it also says "System.argumentException- ToString can only be called from the main thread)








client.cs, line 67. requestMove(string)
Takes a string, but just sets message to inputMove and sendData to true
Console window never prints "in SendMessage", which means it's never getting called
