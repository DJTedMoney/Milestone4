m4 notes:


Client.cs, line 213 (stream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);)
Threw a null reference exception
It was after connecting the debug client (you have to make sure the Mono debugger is attached to the Unity process to see it)
(In "this" in the locals window, it also says "System.argumentException- ToString can only be called from the main thread)








client.cs, line 67. requestMove(string)
Takes a string, but just sets message to inputMove and sendData to true
Console window never prints "in SendMessage", which means it's never getting called
